# What's a partial template?
#* A partial template typically starts with an '_'. For example _line_itme.html.erb.
#* It's a resuable piece of view.
#* A partial is called in a way like: <%= render(@cart.line_items) %>
#* The path of the partial though is implied in the above case: app_root/app/views/line_items/_line_item.html.erb
#* We can refer to the current object using the variable name that matches the name of the template.

# How to indicate in the view that the request is Ajax?
#* Simply add "remote: true" at the end of <%= button_to ..%>

#* Helpers are located in app_root/app/helpers/
