#* P(E)

# When one flips a coin a lot of times, the occurrences of HEADs ____ ____ 50%?
#* trend toward 

# What is the general expression of the probability of some events in rolling dice?
#* P(events) = #-of-possibilities-that-meet-my-conditions / #-of-total-equally-likely-possibilities

# What is a synonym of possibility?
#* likelihood, odds

# What is a different way of saying "my conditions"?
#* constraints, criteria

# What is a different way of saying "the total number of possibilities"
#* sample space

# What is another name for outcome?
#* scenario 

# What is the P(A or B)?
#* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

# What does it mean that A and B are mutually exclusive?
#* It means that P(A and B) = 0

# What does it mean that A includes B?
#* P(A and B) = P(A) ???
