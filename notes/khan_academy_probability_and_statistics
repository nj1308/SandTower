h6. Basic Set Operations
# What's a set?
#* It is a collection of distinct objects.

# What is the operater for intersection?
#* It's a capitalized u upside down.
#* Intersection & Union

# What does null set mean and synonyms and symbol?
#* It means nothing in a set. Synonyms:empty set O with a line through it like this: /

# Define absolute complement.
#* What is in the universe but not in a certain set.

# what is the universal set?
#* It is the entire universe.
h6. Independent and Dependent Events
# What is the symbol for and?
#* an upside-down U

# What is the symbole for given?
#* It is the character |.

# What does expected value mean?
#* Will be talked about later please wait.......

# How to tell if a problem is independent or not.
#* P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B)
#* P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B)

# I learned a new term called "the decision tree".

h6. Basic Probability

# What do we call "flipping a coin" in probability?
#* A trial, an event, or an experiment.

# What is the notation of the probability of event E?
#* P(E)

# When one flips a coin a lot of times, the occurrences of HEADs ____ ____ 50%?
#* trend toward 

# What is the general expression of the probability of some events in rolling dice?
#* P(events) = #-of-possibilities-that-meet-my-conditions / #-of-total-equally-likely-possibilities

# What is a synonym of possibility?
#* likelihood, odds, chances

# What is a different way of saying "my conditions"?
#* constraints, criteria

# What is a different way of saying "the total number of possibilities"
#* sample space

# What is another name for outcome?
#* scenario 

# What is the P(A or B)?
#* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

# What does it mean that A and B are mutually exclusive?
#* It means that P(A and B) = 0

# What does it mean that A includes B?
#* P(A and B) = P(B)

# What does it mean that A is the same as B?
#* P(A) = P(B) = P(A and B)

# Compound probability of independent events

# anomaly
