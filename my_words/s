Diamond
In today's green vs gold match, S's team lost. This made her unhappy. So before sleep, a rematch is in order. Questions and anwers were exchanged between Dad and S about diamonds and oak. In a desperation to make S win, Dad started singing Twinkle-twinkle. Dad asks S to fill the blank. "Twinkle twinkle little stars, like a __ in the sky". S didn't now know what to say. Dad sang it again. Then, S said, "Dad, that's not right." Dad said "What's not right?" S sighed, "It's how I wonder what your are". "Oh, that's right" said Dad, "OK, then Twinkle twinkle liter starts, how I wonder what you are, like a __ in the sky?" S sighed again and looked at Dad incredulously, "It's up above there so high, like a diamond in the sky".

Jingle and Jorgy
When S sleeps over, she puts Jorgy further away form mommy and Jingle closer. When asked, she says, Jingle is not as important, so when mommy tocuhes she won't feel so bad. Mommy then says she's going to tell Jingle what she said and starts moving closer to Jingle. S suddenly sensed the danger and claps her hands around Jingle as if trying to muffle all the sound from mommy.
