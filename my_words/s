Jingle and Jorgy
When S sleeps over, she puts Jorgy further away form mommy and Jingle closer. When asked, she says, Jingle is not as important, so when mommy tocuhes she won't feel so bad. Mommy then says she's going to tell Jingle what she said and starts moving closer to Jingle. S suddenly sensed the danger and claps her hands around Jingle as if trying to muffle all the sound from mommy.
